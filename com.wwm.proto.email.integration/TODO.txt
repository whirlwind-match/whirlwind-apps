

[done] Write a first integration test with outbound SMTP channel, and inbound IMAP
[done] Check that from, subject and body all received correctly as part of test.


Create tests at level of conversation (we inject MimeMessage into receiveChannel, and test correct messages appear on smtpChannel):
	- With conversationService (i.e. abstraction of messageThread in WWM stuff) mocked, send an initial message for a conversation
	
	Scenario 1:
	- Conversation is between 2 people: given ConversationContribution, the test ensures that the correct recipients are looked up, and
	MimeMessages appear on smtpChannel for sending.
	
	- Conversation between > 2 people
	- Conversation where one party has unsubscribed
       
       
       
Which requires:
- canonical data model representing a ConversationContribution (Subject, Text, conversationId, authorId, Mood, copyAuthorFlag)
- Enricher, Transformer & Splitter to create emails for recipients (for large numbers, drop back to using bcc with To: field set to fm.router itself)
